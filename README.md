This repository is about how to do web scraping to get the data in table format via internet, then visualize the data with ggplot2

The link of the website : https://id.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daftar_kecamatan_dan_kelurahan_di_Indonesia

- The data visualization is mostly inspired by the github repository of JuanmaMN.
